Merge two arrays together. And use shell sort algorithm to sort the resulting array which takes O(N^3/2) in the worst case. And scan the whole array to count when there are repetitions between two consecutive elements which takes O(N). Remove the counting with repetitive items with in each array which takes O(N). In total, the whole process takes around O(N^3/2) as required.
