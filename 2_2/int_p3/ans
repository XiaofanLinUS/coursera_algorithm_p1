recursively merge two shuffled array to one shuffled array.

Using i and j for two subarrays and scan from left to right.

when compare two different elements, using uniform random to create 0 or 1.

If 0, move the element from left array to the destination array and i++.
If 1, move the element from right array to the destination array and j++.

When i is out, move the rest of right array to the destination array.
When j is out, move the rest of left array to the destination array.
