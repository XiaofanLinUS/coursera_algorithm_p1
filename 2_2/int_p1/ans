Arr:
[1, 3, 5 ,7 , 2, 4, 6, 8]
 i            j
Aux Arr:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

Switch:

Arr:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8]
             k     j
Aux Arr:
[1, 3, 5, 7]
       i


Arr:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
       	     k
	     j
Aux:
[1, 2, 3, 4]
	    i

Property: i = j,
k will never exceed j. (k <= j)
So, when overwrite the last half of the original array, we do not lose any info of the array when iterating.


Answer:

Do the first n merge operation, and write the result to aux array.
Then, do the rest n merge operation, write the result to the last half of the original array.
Copy the whole aux array to the first half of the original array.
