Recursive Routine:

Randomly, select one bolt v1 from the pile of bolts.
Use v1 to partition the pile of nuts w into three parts. (Using the dutch flag algorithm)

[compare(w, v1) < 0] [compare(w, v1) == 0] [compare(w, v1) > 0]
                     
left pile of nuts    middle pile of nuts   right pile of nuts
     	     	     denote the nuts
		     from the middle
		     pile as w_m
		     
Select another bolt v2 from the pile of bolts,

if(compare(w_m, v2) == 0) put bolt2 into middle pile of bolts
if(compare(w_m, v2) > 0) repeat this recursive routine on the left pile of nuts using v2.
if(compare(w_m, v2) < 0) repeat this recursive routine on the right pile of nuts using v2.

Ending condition for recursive routine:

the size of pile is less or equal to 1.
