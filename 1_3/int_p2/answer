Create two stacks. One is for regular items. The other is for maximums.
Once a push is called.
First push the item to the regular stack.
Then, compare the item with the rest of the maximum stack to
link the item to the appropriate position, Which will take O(n) to operate.

Conclusion:
Each pop operation will take constant time.
Each push operation will take O(n) for the worst case.
