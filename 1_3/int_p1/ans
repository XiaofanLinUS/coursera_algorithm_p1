Create two stacks one for items to be enquequed and the another for items to be dequequed.

Once enqueque gets called push the item to the enqueque stack, which will take one push operation, a constant time operation.
Once dequeque gets called pop all items from the enqueque stack and push them to the dequeque stack. And pop the item out from it.
It would take n push operations and n + 1 pop operations, a total of 2n+1 operations.
However, once dequeque gets called for n times, a total of 3n operations are called on stack. Therefore, on average, there will be 3 operations
per each dequeque operation. Since, pop takes a constant time to execute, dequeque by this way would also takes three times the duration which
also a constant time.
